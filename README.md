# Transcription-system-for-2-channels-phone-calls-
this project is a ready to use transcription system for 2 chennels phone calls using Flask framework , you will be able to transcript calls and get each caller transcript separately , this system doesn't support speaker diarization yet, if you use other technologies other than Flask just put this project in a microservice and you are ready to go .

the file audio_file_post_request.py is for sendig requests to the service , you can use any other wav sound file with 1 or 2 channels(you can use postman instead).
